A high-performance Kafka client written in managed C#.

_Jackdaw aims to be API-compatible with the official Confluent Kafka library, so that any migration to Jackdaw should be seamless, even down to the config settings used._

Jackdaw aims to be:
 - üèÉ High-performance with low memory usage
 - üîß Extensible for use cases such as AWS IAM authentication
 - ü§ù Cross-platform using fully managed code
 - ‚úÖ API-compliant to the official Confluent Kafka library


## Usage
Install the package from NuGet with `dotnet add package Jackdaw`.

Create your producer and/or consumer with the correct settings, and publish/subscribe to the topics you need, as below:

```csharp
var producerConfig = new ProducerConfig
{
    BootstrapServers = "localhost:9092"
};

var consumerConfig = new ConsumerConfig
{
    BootstrapServers = "localhost:9092",
    GroupId = "my-group"
};

using var producer = new ProducerBuilder<string, string>(producerConfig)
    .Build();

using var consumer = new ConsumerBuilder<string, string>(consumerConfig)
    .Build();

producer.Produce("my-topic", new Message<string, string>
{
    Key = "key", Value = "value"
});

consumer.Subscribe("my-topic");

var result = consumer.Consume();
```
